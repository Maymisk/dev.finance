## 🏃‍♂️ My journey

This was one of the very first projects I built, from the time I had just enrolled at the bootcamp.

While developing this I really improved my CSS and JavaScript skills - I ended up applying the same coding style on other projects, like [the Pomofocus clone](https://github.com/Maymisk/pomofocus-basic-clone). On the other hand, it uses the good old 3 file architecture 💀

Nonetheless, lookng back at it, it turned out pretty good 😏
